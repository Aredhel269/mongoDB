# MongoDB Data Structure

Development of MongoDB database structures for managing an optician.

##### Work from Sprint 5.3 of IT-Academy in the Node.js specialization.

### Level 1 - Optica

The project focuses on managing an optician. Here are the key points:

| **Collections** | **Attributes**                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suppliers       | Name, address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code, country), phone, fax, VAT number.                       |
| Glasses         | Brand, lens prescription, frame type (rimless, plastic, or metal), frame color, lens color, price. |
| Customers       | Name, postal address, phone, email, registration date, referring customer (if any).             |
| Sales           | Employee who made the sale, date and time of the sale.                                                                |

#### Modeling:
